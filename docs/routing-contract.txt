Routing Contract
// Initialize Routing Contract
- Initialize supported paths from Factory Contract

// Find Best Route
function FindBestRoute(tokenA, tokenB, amount):
  - Check supported paths
  - Calculate best path and estimated amount_out
  - Return best path and estimated amount_out

// Execute Swap
function ExecuteSwap(user, path[], amount_in, amount_out_min):
  - best_path, estimated_amount_out = FindBestRoute(path[0], path[-1], amount_in)
  - Verify Zk-SNARK proof
  - Check estimated_amount_out >= amount_out_min
  - Loop through best_path:
    - Call Swap() on each Pair Contract
  - Transfer final tokens to user
  - Log 'SwapExecuted' event
